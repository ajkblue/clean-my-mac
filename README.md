Clean My Mac
============
    
Mac OS X can become slow after being used for long time (e.g. 1 year). Deep clean right now is not possible without
paid software.
    
Most Mac OS cleaner apps doesn't really boost the performance as much as advertised. I have tried all sorts of existing apps inside and outside the AppStore - the result wasn't promising.
    
So I come up with an idea of writing a shell script to do this.

I've tried this on 3 of my Macs, 2 MacBook Airs and a iMac, with both running Mac OS X 10.10.3.
The results were fantastic, saving ~4.5 GB on my MacBook Airs and ~7GB on my 2010 iMac, which saved quite a bit of space and sped up the system dramatically. I've also used this in speeding up my family's older Macs, and it works quite well.

Script Usage
=============
    
Download the script execute
```shell
sh clean_my_mac.sh
```
